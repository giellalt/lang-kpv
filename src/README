Komi fst, compiling with XFST or with HFST

Compiling with XFST, the commands are:

make lexfiles
make

Note that the stem lexicon files are situated in the directory working_files/
The morphology (*-lex.txt and *-morph.txt) is situated in this directory.
The lexc files proper are generated to ../../tmp/out/, and the fst-s stored
in ../bin/
