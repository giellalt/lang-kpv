Status for [the source files|https://victorio.uit.no/langtech/trunk/kt/kom/src/]:

* Lexicon: The lexicon contains 12218 entries (5863 nouns, 3990 verbs, 
  1193 adjectives)
* Morphology: The morphology files are 1442 lines long, and contain 163
  continuation lexica. Compared to 9690 lines and 1122 lexica for North Sami,
  there is still work to do.
* Morphophonology: The file xfst-kom.txt is 173 lines long. Compared to
  the one for Greenlandic, 387 lines, the situation is not that bad for Komi.

Tasks ahead:

# Write applications to Russia and Norway
# Test and correct the morphology and morphophonology
# Integrate the Komi-Russian dictionary in the analyser
# Add more words:
## Test the resulting analyser against text material, and add new words
## Systematically add Russian loanwords: names and technical terms
# Work on the spellchecker
