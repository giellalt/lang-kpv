!!!Usage

!!Using the analyser online

The Komi analyser can be used [online|http://giellatekno.uit.no/cgi/index.kom.eng.html].
Here you may paste in Komi text, or generate word forms or inflectional paradigms in Komi.

!!Using the analyser on your own machine

Using the analyser on you own machine opens up for more efficient text processing.
If you participate in work on the Komi analyser, you will need this.

!Prerequisites:

In order to use the Komi analyser ''on your own machine'', you need Unix (Macintosh or Linux).

* On Macintosh, you need to install [the Xcode Developer tools|http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html].
* You need to [check out the source files|http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/tools/docu-svn-user.html] Â (download them to your own machine)
* You need compilation tools from Xerox ([they can be found here|http://www.stanford.edu/~laurik/.book2software/], cf. also [the documentation|http://www.fsmbook.com/])
* Your local Unix guru will know how to set up the ''paths'' so that these programs are available.

!Compilation:

* In the Terminal, go to $GTHOME/kt/kom/src/ and write these two commands, one after 
  the other (they will take several minutes to finish)

{{{
make lexfiles
make
}}}

!Commands for usage on your own machine

If your machine is set up correctly, you have these aliases: 

* __ukom__ for analysis
* __dkom__ for generation

Write 
{{{
ukom
}}}
on the command line. Thereafter you may write a word in Komi, and press enter.
You leave the program by pressing ctrl-C.

There are some Komi texts available. Stand in $GTHOME/kt/kom/. You may then write:

{{{
cat corp/kv-wp.all.100430.txt | preprocess | ukom | less
}}}


[Here is a manual for analysing North Sami|http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/tools/docu-sme-manual.html], the command documented there may be transferred to Komi as well.
