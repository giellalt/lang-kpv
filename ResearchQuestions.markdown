Open Research Questions
=======================

The following document lists some open research questions for Komi.

- What is the range and usage of the comitative ```-кӧд```, instrumental ```-ӧн``` and proprietive ```-а```?
- The ordinals ```мӧд``` and ```кыкӧд``` are both feasible and accepted markers in Literary (Zyrian) Komi, but what are the contexts where ```кыкӧд``` is prefered over ```мӧд``` in order to avoid ambiguity?
- Komi-Zyrian has a future, but the morphological distinction is only observed in the third person ```-ас``` and  ```-асны```, and actually it may also be used as a type of past tense. How can past and future tense usage be contextually distinguished?
